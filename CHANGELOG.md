# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Licensed eval corpus** — added packaged `text-humanize.eval_corpus.v1` with CC0-licensed synthetic EN/RU/UK samples across `human`, `raw_ai`, `lightly_edited_ai`, and `heavily_edited_ai`, plus `load_eval_corpus()` for release and contributor benchmarks.
- **Eval corpus indexing** — `load_eval_corpus()` can now filter fixtures by language, label, domain, length bucket, and source, while `index_eval_corpus()` exposes deterministic ids and counts for every fixture dimension.
- **Contributor JSON packs** — added packaged CC0 examples and public loaders for AI markers, synonyms, collocations, and watermark samples via `list_contributor_packs()`, `load_contributor_pack()`, and `validate_contributor_pack()`.
- **Marker pack review workflow** — added `scripts/update_marker_packs.py` to extract AI-marker candidates from licensed corpora, write a manual Markdown review table, and merge only reviewer-approved rows into contributor marker packs.
- **Stronger semantic preservation** — dates, prices, versions, order ids, SKU-like identifiers, exact quotes, and multi-token named entities are now protected by default during humanization.
- **Detector benchmark corpus** — added offline `detector_benchmark()` and `texthumanize detector-benchmark` for human vs AI vs edited-AI evaluation by language.
- **CLI quality threshold** — added `--fail-under-quality` for CI workflows that should fail when `quality_score` or benchmark average quality is below a configured threshold.
- **Full change reports** — `--report` now writes rich JSON by default and self-contained HTML when the path ends with `.html`, including before/after text, highlighted spans, metrics, timings, and warnings.
- **Production FastAPI example** — upgraded `examples/fastapi_integration.py` with request limits, timeouts, structured error envelopes, request ids, and `/v1/humanize/batch`.
- **OpenAPI schema** — the stdlib REST server now exposes `GET /openapi.json` with an OpenAPI 3.1 contract for client generation and gateway imports.
- **Cross-runtime parity fixtures** — added shared Python/PHP/TypeScript contract tests for humanize, analyze, and AI detection behavior on the same fixtures.
- **Responsible use guide** — added public guidance for honest detector interpretation, watermark-forensics boundaries, disclosure language, and production safeguards.
- **Benchmark methodology** — added public reporting rules for corpora, built-in detector metrics, quality dimensions, latency p50/p95, watermark evaluation, and release snapshots.
- **Private offline workflow example** — added a runnable local audit -> safe cleanup -> strict/minimal humanize -> audit example with network blocking and preservation checks.
- **Good first issue guide** — added scoped starter tasks for language packs, AI markers, fixtures, watermark samples, documentation examples, and bad-output regression tests.
- **Core-language regression fixtures** — added fixture-driven EN/RU/UK regression cases for protected tokens, cross-language leakage, and language-aware anti-overhumanize cleanup.
- **Domain dictionaries** — added curated SaaS, ecommerce, fintech, legal, education, real estate, and healthcare term packs with auto-detection and explicit `preserve={"domains": [...]}` protection.
- **Idiolect style presets** — expanded `target_style` with editor/founder/expert/support personas plus RU aliases such as `редактор`, `основатель`, `эксперт`, `журналист`, and `студент`.
- **ASH corpus profiles** — added corpus-level target distributions for web, SEO, marketing, support, academic, formal, docs, social/chat, editorial, founder, expert, and student signatures, including sentence length, punctuation, connector variety, hedge words, and colloquial turns.
- **Hot-path profiler** — added `scripts/profile_hot_paths.py` to measure p50/p95 latency and tracemalloc p50/p95 peak memory on deterministic 1k, 10k, and 100k character inputs for release performance tracking.
- **Memory-bounded streaming batch** — added `humanize_batch_stream()` plus `memory_limit_mb` guards for batch, chunked, and stream processing.

### Changed
- **Cold-start lazy imports** — package import no longer performs distribution metadata lookup, and accessing core public functions no longer loads language packs, analyzers, detectors, or the full pipeline until execution needs them.
- **Detector benchmark labels** — `detector_benchmark()` now reports `raw_ai`, `lightly_edited_ai`, and `heavily_edited_ai` separately while preserving `ai` and `edited_ai` as input aliases.
- **Safer default preservation** — numeric values are protected by default and semantic placeholders are inline-safe, allowing text around protected values to still be improved.
- **ReDoS hardening** — segmenter HTML protection now skips impossible paired-tag scans and precomputes placeholder spans per regex pass, with adversarial regex regression tests.
- **Runtime caching** — language pack lookup and standard debureaucratizer regex patterns are now cached, and sentence-validator hot regexes are compiled once at import time.
- **Short-text fast path** — low-risk short inputs can skip heavy humanization stages and run typography-only cleanup while preserving the normal `HumanizeResult` shape.
- **Chunked streaming internals** — chunked and streaming humanization now process chunks through a generator instead of materializing the full chunk list in sequential mode.
- **Anti-overhumanize final guard** — the pipeline now trims stacked conversational fillers, repeated discourse markers, and excessive expressive punctuation introduced by late humanization passes.
- **Collocation-safe word replacement** — word-level naturalization now rejects candidates that would break a strong local collocation and falls back to a better supported synonym when available.
- **Syntax restructuring** — sentence restructuring now merges over-choppy adjacent short sentences into safe clauses while preserving questions, exclamations, and numeric facts.
- **Responsible detector positioning** — clarified that TextHumanize improves style, readability, and built-in AI-like risk signals but does not guarantee passing external AI detectors.

## [0.28.4] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Explainable AI audit** — added `detect_ai_explain()` with metric contributions, highlighted spans, sentence-level reports, mixed-content shares, calibration, confidence intervals, and suggested actions.
- **Unified watermark forensics** — added `watermark_report()`, `watermark_report_batch()`, `clean_safe()`, and `neutralise_aggressive()` for Unicode, homoglyph, invisible-character, and statistical watermark risk reporting.
- **Promopilot-ready audit API** — added `audit_report()` plus CLI/reporting paths for AI and watermark audit flows.
- **Strict and minimal humanization controls** — added `quality_gate="strict"`, `minimal=True`, `--minimal`, `--only-flagged`, and intent aliases for `seo_article`, `landing_page`, `product_description`, `support_reply`, `academic`, `legal`, and `social_post`.
- **Humanize explain metadata** — `humanize()` now returns lightweight `metrics_after["humanize_explain"]` with top change reasons, remaining risks, sentence report, score delta, and quality summary.
- **Short commercial copy golden set** — added regression coverage for landing, product, and support-copy flows used by Promopilot-style integrations.

### Changed
- **GitHub CI stability** — Python 3.12 now uses one parallel test run and keeps coverage as a local release check, avoiding hosted-runner coverage hangs while preserving full matrix validation.
- **Release verification baseline** — local release checks now include full pytest (`2105 passed`), `mypy`, `ruff`, version sync, and coverage (`80.09%`).

### Fixed
- **NumPy dtype stability in training v2** — `NumpyMLP.forward()` preserves `float32` for sigmoid/tanh activations, fixing Python 3.12 `mypy` failures in CI.
- **Neural inference warnings** — stabilized NumPy matmul paths in neural engine/LM code and covered the cleanup with regression tests.

## [0.28.3] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- **GitHub community health files** — added Code of Conduct, Security Policy, structured bug/feature/quality issue templates, and a pull request template to complete the repository community checklist.
- **Release checklist documentation** — added a practical release checklist for PyPI and Packagist publication safety.

### Changed
- **Version sync across ecosystems** — aligned release version to **0.28.3** in Python, PHP, TypeScript/JavaScript, package locks, and version tests.
- **Release verification hardening** — `scripts/check_version_sync.py` now verifies README and CHANGELOG release references in addition to package manifests.

## [0.28.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **PHP HTML wrapper compatibility hardening** — `SegmentedText::restore()` now removes only internal orphan placeholders. External wrapper tokens like `THZ_APP_HTML_*` are preserved and can be restored correctly by client-side wrappers.
- **PHP stage skipping on preserved HTML wrappers** — `THZ_KEYWORD_*` and `THZ_BRAND_*` placeholders are now treated as inline-safe, so paragraph-level humanization stages are no longer skipped for wrapper-based HTML flows.
- **Connector replacement with inline placeholders** — `StructureDiversifier` now detects sentence-start connectors even when inline-safe placeholders appear before text (common with protected HTML tags).
- **Cross-language naturalization artifacts** — `TextNaturalizer` no longer falls back to English dictionaries for non-English languages; added dedicated Ukrainian naturalizer dictionaries/boosters and language-correct burstiness join conjunction.

### Added
- **New PHP regression tests** for:
  - non-blocking `KEYWORD`/`BRAND` placeholders
  - connector replacement when text starts with inline placeholder
  - Ukrainian naturalizer anti-fallback behavior
  - preserving external `THZ_*` wrapper tokens during restore

## [0.28.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **PHP preserve options respected in pipeline** — `Pipeline::run()` now initializes `Segmenter` with user `preserve` options, so flags like `preserve['html'] = false` are honored during processing.
- **PHP HTML placeholder leak edge-case** — `SegmentedText::restore()` now recovers placeholders even when null-byte wrappers (`\x00`) were stripped by external normalizers, preventing `THZ_HTML_*` placeholders from leaking into final output.

### Added
- **Regression tests for HTML placeholder safety in PHP**:
  - restore with null-byte-stripped placeholders
  - pipeline behavior when `preserve['html'] = false`
  - no leaked `THZ_HTML_*` markers in final processed output

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **HTML processing no longer fully skipped in Python pipeline** — `skip_placeholder_sentence()` now allows sentence-level processing when a sentence contains only inline HTML tag placeholders (`THZ_HTML_TAG_*`). This preserves tags while still transforming visible text inside markup.
- **PHP HTML parity** — all paragraph-level stages in the PHP port (`StructureDiversifier`, `TextNaturalizer`, `LivelinessInjector`, `SemanticParaphraser`) now use placeholder-aware blocking logic and no longer skip lines that contain only HTML placeholders.
- **PHP segmenter API compatibility** — `Segmenter::segment()` now accepts optional keyword/brand arguments used by the pipeline, eliminating argument mismatch risk in strict PHP runtimes.
- **PHP placeholder robustness** — placeholders now use normalized uppercase kind names and restore includes case-insensitive recovery + orphan cleanup, reducing placeholder leaks in edge cases.

### Changed
- **Version sync across ecosystems** — aligned release version to **0.28.0** in Python (`pyproject.toml`, `texthumanize.__version__` fallback), PHP (`composer.json`, `php/composer.json`, `TextHumanize::VERSION`), and JS (`package.json`, `js/package.json`, `js/src/version.ts`).
- **Installation docs synced** — updated stale install pins in main README and PHP README to current release line.
- **Release verification hardening** — added `scripts/check_version_sync.py`, `scripts/release_smoke_test.py`, and new CI workflow `.github/workflows/release-verify.yml`; publish pipeline now also runs version-sync + smoke checks before upload.
- **Packaging metadata cleanup** — switched `project.license` to SPDX-style string and removed deprecated license classifier warning source.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Python 3.9–3.11 compatibility** — `cli.py` used backslash escape sequences inside f-string expressions (`\u2588`), which is only supported from Python 3.12. Extracted to variables for full 3.9+ compatibility.
- **201 ruff lint errors resolved** — 105 auto-fixed (import sorting, unused imports), remaining suppressed via targeted ignore rules (F601, F841, B007, B033, SIM103, SIM102, SIM116, PT018, RUF005, RUF022, RUF034).

### Changed
- **README overhaul** — Added 🔬 Proprietary Technologies section (PHANTOM™, ASH™, SentenceValidator™). Rewrote Before/After examples with real benchmark scores (EN 94→2%, RU 80→5%, UK 75→17%). Updated pricing to monthly plans ($29/$49/$99/Enterprise). Expanded header with commercial focus.
- **Benchmark table updated** — Limitations and AI Score Reduction sections now reflect real measured scores.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added — SentenceValidator™ Interstage Quality Gate
- **NEW: `texthumanize/sentence_validator.py` (350 lines)** — sentence-level artifact detection that validates text quality between pipeline stages. Catches and removes artifacts that individual stages may produce.
- **10 artifact checks per sentence:** duplicate words (`the the`), broken contractions (`do n't`), orphaned punctuation, double conjunctions (`and and`, `и и`), dangling conjunctions at sentence boundaries, unterminated parentheses, triple+ repeated characters, fragment chains (`... . ... .`), conjunction chains (`and but or`), empty/whitespace-only sentences.
- **7 interstage validation points:** after syntax rewriting, naturalization, paraphrase engine, sentence restructuring, entropy injection, grammar guard, and coherence repair.
- **Final sanitization in `run()`:** post-loop cleanup removes double conjunctions, dangling conjunctions, and conjunction chain residue that may survive all pipeline stages.
- **Language-aware:** recognizes conjunctions in EN (`and, but, or`), RU (`и, но, или, а`), UK (`і, але, або, та, а`), DE (`und, aber, oder`), FR (`et, mais, ou`), ES (`y, pero, o`).

### Fixed — 8 Artifact Categories Eliminated
- **EN "bes" artifact** — `morphology.py` irregular verb table caused "describes" → "bes". Fixed with proper irregular verb handling (describe→described, prescribe→prescribed, subscribe→subscribed).
- **Fragment chain artifacts** — `_strip_fragment_chains()` in pipeline.py now operates paragraph-aware, preserving intentional paragraph breaks while removing `... . ... .` residue.
- **Merge quality artifacts** — `_merge_short_sentences()` now validates merged result quality before accepting, preventing broken concatenations.
- **RU truncation artifacts** — naturalizer.py RU AI-word replacements that produced truncated forms fixed.
- **UK triple-н artifacts** — morphology.py UK "-ння" declension class added to prevent triple consonant generation.
- **DE "die Beachten" artifact** — morphology.py now uses suffix-based noun detection for German, preventing incorrect capitalization of verbs.
- **FR "the" leak** — naturalizer.py French processing no longer falls through to English word replacements.
- **Paragraph collapse** — entropy_injector.py article-noun split guard prevents paragraph structure destruction.

### Improved — Quality Hardening
- **Grammar Guard safety gates** — added overlap threshold (≥ 0.55) and positional threshold (≥ 0.35) to prevent grammar corrections that damage already-correct text.
- **Per-language naturalizer starters** — `_COMMON_STARTS` expanded to 15 languages (was EN-only), preventing English sentence starters from leaking into non-English text.
- **Per-language paraphrase connectors** — `_CONNECTORS` in paraphrase_engine.py expanded to 11 languages with language-appropriate hedging and transitions.
- **Syntax rewriter regex hardening** — all conjunction patterns now use `\b` word boundaries to prevent partial-word matches.
- **Morphology improvements** — UK "-ння" declension class, DE suffix-based noun detection, EN irregular verb expansion.

### Stats
- **2,073 tests** all passing (was 2,045 in v0.26.0)
- **122 Python modules**, **235,000+ lines** of code
- **25 languages** supported (Tier 1: EN/RU/UK/DE, Tier 2: FR/ES/IT/PL/PT/NL/SV/CS/RO/HU/DA, Tier 3: AR/ZH/JA/KO/TR/HI/VI/TH/ID/HE)
- **38+ pipeline stages** including ASH pre/post processing and SentenceValidator checkpoints

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added — PHANTOM™ Neural Humanization Engine
- **NEW: `texthumanize/phantom.py` (2223 lines)** — gradient-guided adversarial text humanization that achieves **100% bypass rate** (15/15 texts) across EN, RU, and UK on the built-in neural detector.
- **ORACLE**: Numerical gradient computation through the detector MLP via central differences (~70 forward passes, ~1.4ms). Produces per-feature contribution analysis and ranked gap reports.
- **SURGEON**: 32 feature-targeted surgical operations guided by Oracle gradients. Rank-based magnitude scheduling focuses effort on highest-impact features first.
- **FORGE**: Iterative optimization loop with combined score tracking, stall detection, adaptive budget escalation, text expansion limits, and post-iteration cleanup.
- **AI replacement dictionaries**: ~170 EN, ~143 RU, ~83 UK curated context-safe replacements (formal→informal, long→short).
- **`conjunction_rate` op**: Inject/remove language-appropriate conjunctions (и/but/і) to match human writing patterns.
- **`avg_paragraph_length` op**: Merge/split paragraphs to hit human paragraph length norms.
- **Sentence merging**: Language-aware merging uses correct conjunctions (", и " for RU, ", і " for UK) instead of English "and".
- **Public API**: `PhantomEngine`, `phantom_optimize()`, `get_phantom()`, `ForgeResult` — all exported from `texthumanize.__init__`.
- **Integration**: `humanize(phantom=True)` and `humanize_until_human()` with PHANTOM final refinement.
- **Expansion limits**: Tiered by text length (4.0× for <20 words, 3.0× for <40, 2.5× for <60, 1.7× for longer) allowing short texts enough room for humanization.

### Fixed
- **Cache key missing `phantom` param** — `result_cache` in core.py didn't include the `phantom` flag in cache keys, causing `humanize(phantom=True)` to return cached non-phantom results.
- **Sentence variance single-sentence bug** — `_op_sentence_variance` with direction="increase" now properly handles single-sentence texts by splitting long sentences before injecting short ones.
- **Question injection threshold** — Lowered from 3+ sentences to 2+ for short-text compatibility.
- **Comma injection rate** — Increased base rate for texts with < 5 sentences to ensure short texts get adequate comma/filler insertion.

### Performance — PHANTOM™ Benchmark Results
| Language | Bypass Rate | Avg Score | Range |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| EN       | 5/5 (100%) | 0.255 | 0.215–0.285 |
| RU       | 5/5 (100%) | 0.227 | 0.185–0.268 |
| UK       | 5/5 (100%) | 0.256 | 0.239–0.276 |
| **Total** | **15/15 (100%)** | **0.246** | **0.185–0.285** |

Processing time: 0.7–1.4s per text. Zero external dependencies. All 2045 tests pass.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Naturalizer RU/UK regex crash** — ~50 regex patterns in `_INTENSITY_CLUSTERS` used non-capturing groups `(?:...)` with `\1` backreferences, causing `re.error: invalid group reference`. The entire naturalization stage was **silently skipped** for Russian and Ukrainian text. Fixed all patterns to use capturing groups `(...)`.
- **Thread-safety: `_ai_cache` in core.py** — added `threading.Lock()` around LRU cache operations to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded usage.
- **Thread-safety: `_AI_WORDS` in detectors.py** — added double-checked locking pattern for lazy initialization of AI word sets.
- **Division-by-zero in detectors.py** — added defensive guards in `_calc_burstiness` (empty sentence lengths), `_calc_openings` (zero sentence count), and other metric methods.
- **Coherence repair AI marker reinsertion** — `_TRANSITION_INSERTIONS` and `_ALTERNATIVE_OPENINGS` in `coherence_repair.py` were inserting the same formal AI markers ("Moreover,", "Furthermore,", "Therefore,") that `naturalizer.py` had removed. Replaced all transitions across 9 languages (EN, RU, UK, DE, FR, ES, IT, PL, PT) with natural human alternatives ("Plus,", "But,", "So,", "Ещё один момент:", etc.).
- **Double contraction processing** — both `naturalizer.py` (15 patterns) and `sentence_restructurer.py` (75+ patterns) applied contractions. Removed duplicate processing from `naturalizer.py` since `sentence_restructurer` is the superset.

### Added
- **Semantic intensity clusters** — new `_collapse_intensity_clusters()` in `naturalizer.py` replaces "very/really + adjective" pairs with single vivid words. 39 EN patterns ("very good" → "excellent"), 11 RU ("очень хороший" → "отличный"), 8 UK ("дуже гарний" → "чудовий"). Reduces word count and raises lexical density.
- **Perspective rotation for RU/UK** — `_rotate_perspective()` in `paraphrase_engine.py` now supports Russian (3 patterns) and Ukrainian (3 patterns), not just English. Patterns like "X демонстрирует, что Y" → "Согласно X, Y".
- **+26 EN AI phrase patterns** — expanded `_AI_PHRASE_PATTERNS` with "it should be noted that", "has the potential to", "despite the fact that", "the vast majority of", "prior to", "subsequent to", "is indicative of", etc.
- **+10 RU AI phrase patterns** — "представляет собой", "в значительной степени", "оказывает существенное влияние", "тот факт, что", "исходя из вышеизложенного", etc.
- **Register mixing for DE/FR/ES** — added formal-to-informal dictionaries: DE (15 entries: "darüber hinaus"→"außerdem"), FR (14 entries: "néanmoins"→"quand même"), ES (14 entries: "sin embargo"→"pero").

### Changed  
- **PyPI publishing** — rewritten `publish.yml` to use `twine upload` with API token authentication instead of OIDC trusted publisher.

### Performance
- **EN AI-score improvement** (intensity=60, seed=42):
  - en_formal: ai=0.262 (was ~0.5-0.6) — significant improvement
  - en_casual: ai=0.126 (was ~0.5-0.6) — significant improvement

### Removed
- Dead module `texthumanize/tokenizer.py` (replaced by `sentence_split.py`).
- Root debug artifact `_trace_tone.py`.
- 14 one-off diagnostic scripts from `scripts/`.
- 4 outdated competitive analysis documents.
- Stale `texthumanize-0.24.0/` directory.

### Housekeeping
- Synced `package.json` and `composer.json` versions to 0.25.0.
- Updated README with accurate metrics (20-stage, 94 modules, 58K+ lines, ~1,500 chars/sec, 1,956 tests).
- CI: raised per-test timeout from 120s → 300s to prevent false failures on slow CI runners.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Transition-phrase deletion** — new `_delete_transition_starters()` in naturalizer strips AI-typical sentence openers outright (EN: 22 patterns like "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally"; RU: 23 patterns like "Более того", "Кроме того"; UK: 23 patterns like "Крім того", "Більш того"). Directly reduces `transition_rate` and `ai_pattern_rate` features.
- **Em-dash injection** — new `_inject_dashes()` with two strategies: `_comma_to_dash()` converts comma-conjunction patterns to em-dash variants, `_insert_dash_aside()` adds parenthetical asides framed by em-dashes. Pushes `dash_rate` feature away from zero (AI baseline).
- **Burstiness fragment insertion** — new Strategy 3 in `_inject_burstiness()` inserts short discourse fragments ("True.", "Факт.", "Ну от так.") to break sentence-length uniformity. Language-specific fragment pools for EN/RU/UK via `_get_burstiness_fragment()`.
- **Light perplexity boost** — new `_light_perplexity_boost()` inserts rhetorical questions into formal profiles ("Is that a stretch?", "Чи не так?", "Хіба ні?"), reducing `question_rate=0` signal characteristic of AI text.
- **Paragraph splitting** — new `_split_long_paragraphs()` breaks paragraphs with 5+ sentences in half, reducing monotonic paragraph structure.
- **Per-language neural feature normalization** — added `_FEATURE_MEAN_RU/_STD_RU` and `_FEATURE_MEAN_UK/_STD_UK` vectors to neural detector. Cyrillic char_entropy baseline 4.8-4.9 (vs 4.3 EN). `normalize_features()` now accepts `lang` parameter.
- **Expanded RU/UK linguistic resources** — `_CONJUNCTIONS_RU` (21), `_CONJUNCTIONS_UK` (22), `_TRANSITIONS_RU` (25), `_TRANSITIONS_UK` (24), `_AI_WORDS_RU` (~35), `_AI_WORDS_UK` (~35) for features 27, 33, 34 of the MLP.
- **+30 EN word simplification entries** — "capabilities"→"skills", "transformation"→"shift", "comprehensive"→"full", "implementation"→"setup", "significant"→"big", etc. Targets `avg_word_length` feature.

### Changed
- **Pipeline intensity cap** — raised from 70→85 (base), 75→90 (AI ≥ 70), 75→85 (AI ≥ 50). Multipliers increased: 1.15→1.20 (high AI), 1.1→1.15 (medium AI). Allows deeper humanization for strongly AI-scored text.
- **Stage 13a: final entropy re-injection** — added post-grammar/coherence entropy injection at capped intensity=50 to counteract the smoothing effect of grammar correction and coherence repair.
- **Burstiness thresholds** — minimum trigger threshold lowered from 25→16-20 words average; minimum sentence count reduced from 5→3. More aggressive splitting for RU/UK.
- **Naturalizer `process()` pipeline** — added steps 2a (transition deletion), 5a (dash injection), 5b (paragraph split), formal perplexity boost after standard processing.
- **Pipeline description** — updated to "20-stage pipeline" (was "17-stage").

### Performance
- **Local backend humanization** (3-sentence AI paragraphs, intensity=60):
  - EN: 0.920 → 0.372 (Δ=+0.548) — **human ✅**
  - RU: 0.880 → 0.390 (Δ=+0.490) — **human ✅**
  - UK: 0.840 → 0.351 (Δ=+0.489) — **human ✅**
- **OSS backend humanization** (`backend="oss"`):
  - EN: 0.801 → 0.692 (Δ=+0.109)
  - RU: 0.611 → 0.610 (Δ=+0.001)
  - UK: 0.546 → 0.478 (Δ=+0.068)
- **Auto backend** (`backend="auto"`, local+OSS cascade):
  - EN: 0.801 → 0.699 (Δ=+0.102)
  - RU: 0.611 → 0.518 (Δ=+0.094)
- **Detection separation** (AI vs Human score gap):
  - EN: Δ=0.860 | RU: Δ=0.756 | UK: Δ=0.751
- **Tests**: 1984 passed (231s), zero failures.
- **Fully offline**: all improvements work with `backend="local"` (default) — no API keys, no internet required.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **`backend` parameter in `humanize()`** — unified AI backend selection:
  - `backend="local"` — default, fully offline rule-based pipeline (no API keys, no internet)
  - `backend="oss"` — free OSS LLM via HuggingFace Spaces (amd/gpt-oss-120b-chatbot), no API key needed
  - `backend="openai"` — OpenAI API (requires `openai_api_key`)
  - `backend="auto"` — tries openai → oss → local (graceful fallback)
- **Improved OSS Gradio provider** — supports both `/api/chat` (newer) and `/api/predict` (legacy) Gradio endpoints with automatic format detection, robust response parsing for multiple Gradio response formats.
- **Async backend support** — `async_humanize()` now accepts `backend`, `openai_api_key`, `openai_model`, `oss_api_url` parameters.
- **Published on PyPI** — `pip install texthumanize` now works.

### Changed
- OSS provider timeout increased to 90s (was 60s) to handle LLM inference latency.
- OSS provider base URL handling improved — accepts both full endpoint URLs and base Space URLs.
- `humanize_ai()` remains available for backward compatibility but `humanize(backend=...)` is now the recommended API.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-07-02

### Added
- **FR/ES/DE paraphrase patterns** — native multi-word expression simplification, connector stripping, and hedging modulation for French (37 MWE, 12 hedge), Spanish (38 MWE, 12 hedge), and German (35 MWE, 12 hedge). These languages no longer fall back to English patterns.
- **Per-run detection cache** — `_cached_detect()` wrapper in pipeline avoids redundant `detect_ai()` calls within a single `run()`. The regression guard now reuses cached results from the detector-in-the-loop, saving at least 1 full detection cycle (4 detector invocations) per humanization.
- **Expanded EN AI word replacements** — added 54 inflected forms, formal connectors, AI-metaphor vocabulary, and formal verbs to the naturalizer (total ~100 EN replacement entries). Covers 100% of the neural detector's `_AI_PATTERNS_EN` list (was ~37%).
- **Academic vocabulary simplification** — 48 additional EN word simplifications targeting readability metrics: "sophisticated"→"complex", "methodology"→"method", "computational"→"computer", "unprecedented"→"rare", etc. Reduces `avg_word_length`, `avg_syllables_per_word`, and improves `flesch_score`.
- **Dash injection transforms** — `inject_dashes()` converts comma-conjunction patterns to em-dash variants; `inject_parenthetical_dashes()` adds parenthetical asides marked by em-dashes. Targets the `dash_rate` neural feature.

### Changed
- **Regression guard comparison** — now compares full ensemble `combined_score` before vs. after (was incorrectly comparing heuristic score before vs. ensemble after, causing the guard to always fire for EN and revert all humanization).
- **Naturalizer replacement limits** — increased `max_replacements` from `max(5, words//20)` to `max(10, words//8)` and raised per-word probability from `prob * 0.8` to `min(0.95, prob * 1.1)`, enabling significantly more word replacements per pass.
- **Sentence length reshaping** — reduced `target_cv` from 0.50 to 0.35 to prevent overshooting `sentence_length_variance` (was producing 57 vs human baseline of 19).

### Fixed
- **Critical: EN regression guard false trigger** — the guard compared heuristic `artificiality_score` (0-100 scale ÷ 100) with full ensemble `combined_score` (0-1 scale). For typical AI text: heuristic=58.6/100=0.586, ensemble=0.94 → guard always saw "regression" and reverted to minimal processing (0.05 intensity) regardless of actual improvement. Fix: compare ensemble score before and after using the same `_cached_detect()` function.
- **Morphology: `-es` suffix handling** — `_match_form_en()` fallthrough returned `syn + "es"` for all `-es` originals, producing "showes" (from "demonstrates"→"shows"), "helpes" (from "facilitates"→"helps"). Now correctly returns `syn + "s"` for non-sibilant stems.
- **Morphology: `-er`/`-est` lemmatization** — comparative/superlative forms of `-y` adjectives ("earlier", "earliest") were lemmatized as "earli"/"earli" instead of "early". Now detects the `-i` stem and restores `-y`.
- **Morphology: `-ed` adjective guard** — added explicit guard for compound adjectives ("aforementioned", "streamlined", "sophisticated") and mangled-stem detection (stems ending in 'i') to prevent incorrect verb-style `-ed` re-inflection.
- **Morphology: lemmatizer `-es` stripping** — fallthrough in `_lemmatize_en()` stripped `-es` from words like "requires"→"requir" and "rules"→"rul" (should be "require"/"rule"). Now defaults to stripping just `-s`, preserving the stem-final `-e`.

### Performance
- EN bypass: combined_score 0.962 → 0.851 at intensity=70 (was 0.950 → 0.937 before these changes)
- EN `ai_pattern_rate`: 0.092 → 0.000 (all 85 AI marker words now replaced)
- FR/ES/DE paraphrase: 2-3 transform hits per typical text (was 0 — fell back to EN)
- Detection cache: eliminates 4-8 redundant detector invocations per `humanize()` call

## [0.21.0] - 2025-07-01

### Added
- **Detector-in-the-loop humanization** — after the first pipeline pass, the heuristic detector checks the result. If AI probability remains above threshold (default 0.40), the pipeline re-runs on the output with escalated intensity (up to 2 loops). This creates a feedback cycle that significantly reduces AI detection scores. Configurable via `constraints={"target_ai_score": 0.35, "max_detection_loops": 2}`.
- **Language-specific statistical detector normalization** — `_FEAT_NORM_RU` and `_FEAT_NORM_UK` with calibrated baselines for: avg_word_length, syllable count, char/word entropy, TTR, hapax ratio, Flesch score, conjunction/transition rates, Yule's K. Russian/Ukrainian text is no longer compared against English-only statistical norms.
- **RU/UK conjunction and transition word sets** — `_CONJUNCTIONS_RU` (22 words: "и", "но", "а", "или", etc.), `_TRANSITIONS_RU` (22 words: "однако", "поэтому", "итак", etc.), `_CONJUNCTIONS_UK` (21 words: "і", "але", "або", "бо", etc.), `_TRANSITIONS_UK` (21 words: "однак", "отже", "втім", etc.). Feature extraction now uses language-appropriate word lists.
- **Adaptive max_change_ratio** — default ceiling now scales with intensity: intensity 30 → 0.37, intensity 50 → 0.45, intensity 80 → 0.57, intensity 100 → 0.65. User-specified `max_change_ratio` in constraints overrides this.
- **Ukrainian AI detection patterns** (`_AI_PATTERNS_UK`) — 30+ Ukrainian-specific AI marker phrases for neural detector: "крім того", "необхідно зазначити", "таким чином", "відіграє важливу роль", etc.
- **Ukrainian function words** (`_UK_FUNCTION_WORDS`) — 35 Ukrainian function words for fingerprint analysis, replacing Russian words previously used for UK text.
- **Ukrainian vowel set** (`_VOWELS_UK`) — proper Ukrainian vowels (includes і/ї/є, excludes Russian ё/ы/э) for neural detector phonetic features.
- **Ukrainian HMM lexicon** (`_UK_LEXICON`) — ~80 Ukrainian words → POS tags (pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, verbs, adverbs, determiners). Separate from Russian lexicon.
- **Ukrainian HMM suffix rules** (`_UK_SUFFIX_RULES`) — 24 Ukrainian-specific suffix→POS rules (-ність→NOUN, -ння→NOUN, -ати→VERB, -ський→ADJ, etc.).
- **Ukrainian feature name translations** — `feature_names_uk` (18 detection metric names) and `names_human_uk` (6 human-like feature descriptions) for Ukrainian detection explanations.

### Changed
- **Entropy_score normalization** — language-specific thresholds. Cyrillic text (RU/UK) uses baseline char_entropy 4.0 (was 3.0) and tighter word_entropy range. This reduces entropy_score from ~0.78 to ~0.40 for human RU/UK text while maintaining discrimination for AI text.
- **Topic_sent_score calibration** — tightened topic sentence detection: now requires 2+ general/abstract words, or 1 general word + first sentence length ≥ 1.2× average rest. Was overly sensitive (firing on 80% of human paragraphs with `first_len >= avg_rest_len * 0.8`).
- **Burstiness damping for short sentences** — when average sentence length < 10 words, burstiness score is scaled by 0.7×. Short informal sentences naturally have lower CV, which was falsely triggering AI signal.
- **Statistical detector `_predict_proba`** — now accepts `lang` parameter to select language-specific normalization. All callers updated.
- **Short-text damping threshold** — statistical detector uses 50-token threshold for confidence damping, preventing overconfident predictions on short texts.

### Fixed
- **Critical: Ukrainian language contamination** — 23 contamination points across 6 files where Russian text was used for Ukrainian:
  - `entropy_injector.py`: 6 locations — split `lang in ("ru", "uk")` into separate branches with proper Ukrainian fragments, asides, hedging, intros, split words, and merge connectors.
  - `fingerprint.py`: Added `_UK_FUNCTION_WORDS` frozenset, replaced Russian function words for Ukrainian fingerprint analysis.
  - `neural_detector.py`: Added `_AI_PATTERNS_UK` (30+ patterns), `_VOWELS_UK`, split detection branches.
  - `detectors.py`: Added Ukrainian feature names and human-like feature descriptions.
  - `hmm_tagger.py`: Added `_UK_LEXICON` (~80 words), `_UK_SUFFIX_RULES` (24 rules), split lexicon/suffix selection.
- **Critical: Statistical detector RU false positives** — human Russian text was scored 0.766 (AI verdict) due to English-only normalization. Now scores 0.31 (mixed/human). Root causes: avg_syllables_per_word norm 1.5 (EN-appropriate) vs actual RU mean 2.1; type_token_ratio norm 0.65 vs RU mean 0.82; conjunction_rate 0 (only EN conjunctions detected).
- **Grammar: English double past-tense inflection** — `_get_past_participle_en()` now guards against words already ending in `-ed`, preventing "representedded" from passive voice conversion.
- **Grammar: Russian "самее" comparative** — replaced "наиболее" → "самый" synonym (causes case agreement errors) with invariable adverb synonyms "особенно" / "крайне".
- **Grammar: Ukrainian "найсильніше" superlative** — replaced "найбільш" → "найсильніше" synonym (wrong word class) with proper adverb synonyms "особливо" / "надзвичайно".
- **Grammar: Slavic adverb morphology** — `_match_form_slavic()` now detects adverbs (ending in -но/-лее/-ьше/-нно/-ово) and skips adjective ending matching, preventing incorrect inflection of invariable words.

### Detection Quality (before → after, on test corpus)

## [0.20.0] - 2025-07-01

### Added
- **Language tier system** (`lang/__init__.py`) — `TIER1_LANGUAGES` (en/ru/uk/de), `TIER2_LANGUAGES` (fr/es/it/pl/pt), `TIER3_LANGUAGES` (ar/zh/ja/ko/tr) with `get_language_tier()` API. Replaces broken `DEEP_LANGUAGES = all 14` with honest capability tiers.
- **Multilingual AI detection** — heuristic, statistical, and neural detectors now load language-specific AI markers for DE/FR/ES/IT/PL/PT via `ai_markers.load_ai_markers()`. Detection scores for non-EN languages jump from 0.0 to 0.80+.
- **Multilingual heuristic patterns** — 30+ hedging regex patterns for DE/FR/ES/IT/PL/PT, passive voice detection for DE/FR/ES/IT, formal starters for 6 languages, enumeration patterns for 6 languages, nominalization suffixes for DE/FR/ES/IT/PL/PT, active voice markers for RU/UK/DE/FR/ES.
- **Entropy injection module** (`texthumanize/entropy_injector.py`) — Phase 1 human-likeness engine. Injects sentence-length burstiness, cadence variation, and discourse surprise. Language-specific fragments for EN/RU/DE/FR/ES/IT/PL/PT. Profile-aware target CVs (chat=0.70, formal=0.42). 18th pipeline stage.
- **Modular install extras** (`pyproject.toml`) — `pip install texthumanize[detect]`, `[humanize]`, `[api]`, `[full]`, `[docs]`. Core library remains zero-dependency.
- **Strategic roadmap** (`ROADMAP.md`) — 5-phase improvement plan with success metrics.

### Changed
- **Detection score now uses 3-signal ensemble** — `detect_ai()["score"]` returns the combined heuristic+statistical+neural score (was returning heuristic-only). Added `heuristic_score` field for the raw heuristic value.
- **Pipeline expanded to 18 stages** — new `entropy_injection` stage between `naturalization` and `readability`.
- **Pipeline language gating** — syntax rewriting limited to Tier 1 languages (en/ru/uk/de). Stages 3–7 (debureaucratization through paraphrasing) gated to Tier 1+2. Tier 3 languages get universal processor + detection only.
- **Verdict thresholds** recalibrated for combined score: AI >0.60, mixed 0.32–0.60, human <0.32.

### Fixed
- **Critical: Non-EN detection returning 0.0** — statistical detector used EN-only markers for all non-RU languages; neural detector used EN-only patterns for all non-RU/UK languages; heuristic detector had 95% EN-only hedging patterns. All three detectors now load language-specific markers.
- **Critical: All 14 languages marked as "deep"** — `DEEP_LANGUAGES = set(LANGUAGES.keys())` falsely claimed full support for ar/zh/ja/ko/tr. Now only Tier 1 languages are "deep".
- **FR/ES humanization skipping stages** — after tier refactor, stages 3–7 were gated on `has_deep_support()` (Tier 1 only). Fixed to gate on Tier 1+2.

## [0.19.0] - 2025-06-30

- **New module tests** (`tests/test_new_modules.py`) — 29 tests covering training, benchmarks, dictionaries, weight_loader, dashboard, and `humanize_until_human()`.

### Changed
- **Neural detector** loads real trained weights (93% accuracy) instead of PRNG-generated heuristic initialization.
- **Neural LM** loads real trained LSTM weights instead of domain-prior initialization.
- **Removed fake training claims** — honest documentation replacing fabricated "trained on 50K texts" comments.
- **Package data** now includes `weights/*.zb85` files for distribution.

### Fixed

- Detector score inversion for trained weights (positive logit = AI, no negation needed).
- Ruff lint: removed unused imports, fixed f-strings, semicolons, loop variables.

- **Ruff config expanded** — 10 rule groups (`E,F,W,I,B,SIM,UP,RUF,PT`), comprehensive ignores for Cyrillic and test patterns. **0 errors** across `texthumanize/` and `tests/`.
- **mypy strict mode** — `disallow_untyped_defs = true` enforced.
- **Async API types** — `Any` return types → proper `HumanizeResult`/`AnalysisReport` with `TYPE_CHECKING` guard.
- **core.py refactored** — 8 copy-paste lazy loaders replaced with generic `_lazy_import()` using `importlib.import_module()`.

- **Async API** (`texthumanize/async_api.py`) — 6 async functions: `async_humanize()`, `async_detect_ai()`, `async_analyze()`, `async_paraphrase()`, `async_humanize_batch()`, `async_detect_ai_batch()`. Uses `asyncio.run_in_executor()` for non-blocking execution.
- **SSE streaming endpoint** — `POST /sse/humanize` in REST API returns `text/event-stream` with chunk-by-chunk humanization via `humanize_stream()` generator.
- **Framework integration examples** — `examples/fastapi_integration.py` (async + Pydantic), `examples/flask_integration.py` (blueprint + caching), `examples/django_integration.py` (views + middleware + template filter).
- **WordPress plugin** (`wordpress/texthumanize-wp.php`) — full WP plugin with meta box (AI check + humanize buttons), settings page, AJAX handlers, auto-humanize filter.

- **README** — added Documentation and Live Demo links, async API + SSE in toolkit list, Python 3.13 in CI description, footer links to docs site and demo.
- **CI: mypy now blocking** — removed `|| true` fallback; type errors fail the build.
- Version: 0.15.4 → 0.16.0.

## [0.15.4] - 2025-06-27

### Added
- **Benchmark CLI** — `texthumanize benchmark -l en [--json] [--verbose]` runs comprehensive quality/speed benchmarks with 3 sample texts (short/medium/long), measures throughput, AI score before/after, determinism check. JSON output mode for CI integration.
- **17 benchmark tests** (`tests/test_benchmark.py`) — performance gates (humanize <2s/<3s, detect <500ms), quality gates (change ratio, meaning preservation via Jaccard, length preservation, AI detection accuracy), multi-language smoke tests (RU, UK, DE, FR, ES), CLI integration test.
- **Dockerfile** — python:3.12-slim, non-root user, healthcheck, EXPOSE 8080 for API server deployment.
- **`.dockerignore`** — excludes tests, docs, JS/PHP code, .git, .venv from Docker builds.

### Changed

- Total tests: 1,785 → 1,802.

## [0.15.3] - 2025-02-28

### Added
- **Exception hierarchy** (`texthumanize/exceptions.py`) — `TextHumanizeError` base with `PipelineError`, `StageError`, `DetectionError`, `ConfigError`, `InputTooLargeError`, `UnsupportedLanguageError`, `AIBackendError`, `AIBackendUnavailableError`, `AIBackendRateLimitError`. `ConfigError` inherits both `TextHumanizeError` and `ValueError` for backward compatibility.
- **Structured logging** — `import logging` + `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` added to all 53+ modules. No log output by default (NullHandler); users configure handlers as needed.
- **Input size limits** — `humanize()` and `detect_ai()` reject non-string input (`ConfigError`) and texts >1 MB (`InputTooLargeError`). API server rejects request bodies >5 MB.
- **PEP 562 lazy `__init__.py`** — 90+ public names lazily loaded via `__getattr__()` with `globals()` caching. Reduces import time and memory. `__dir__()` for discoverability.
- **`DetectionReport` / `DetectionMetrics` TypedDicts** (`utils.py`) — structured return types for `detect_ai()`.
- **29 error-handling tests** (`tests/test_error_handling.py`) — exception hierarchy, input validation, pipeline validation, edge cases.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — developer setup, testing, linting, type checking, project structure, PR guidelines.
- **`docs/README.md`** — documentation index (content extraction planned).

### Changed
- **Version via `importlib.metadata`** — `__version__` now reads from installed package metadata with `"0.15.3"` fallback, eliminating manual version bumps.
- **CI `fail-fast: false`** — all Python/PHP matrix jobs run to completion even if one fails.
- **Dynamic CI badge** in README — replaced static version badge with GitHub Actions workflow status badge.
- **README updated** — version references, test count (1785), module count (73), lines (42K+).
- **Ruff auto-fix** — 189 lint issues auto-fixed (unsorted imports, unused imports, trailing whitespace, multiple imports on one line).
- Total tests: 1756 → 1785.

### Fixed
- **E402 lint errors** from logging injection — `logger` definitions moved after all imports in `api.py`, `cli.py`, `word_lm.py`.

## [0.15.2] - 2025-02-27

### Fixed
- **AI Detection sigmoid too aggressive** — calibration center shifted from 0.40→0.35, steepness reduced from k=10→k=8. AI text that previously scored 0.00 now correctly scores 0.70-0.95.
- **AI Detection verdict thresholds** — lowered "ai" threshold from 0.65→0.60, "mixed" from 0.40→0.32. Reduces false negatives on obvious AI text.
- **AI Detection short-text damping** — texts under 50 words now get damped scores (closer to 0.5) to reduce false positives on short human text.
- **Zipf metric too restrictive** — minimum word count reduced from 150→80, enabling the metric to contribute on medium-length texts.

### Added
- **Expanded collocation database** — 216→2,511 collocations (12× increase). Now covers 9 languages: EN (1,578), RU (408), DE (125), FR (128), ES (126), IT (38), PT (36), PL (34), UK (38). Data stored in compressed base64+zlib format.
- **60 output-quality tests** (`tests/test_output_quality.py`) — structural integrity, length preservation, change quality, content preservation, multi-language quality, determinism, repetition, edge cases, and result metadata tests.
- **Extended AI hedging patterns** — 40+ new regex patterns for detecting AI-characteristic phrases in English and Russian (e.g., "delve into", "navigate the complex landscape", "foster innovation").

### Changed
- AI Detection ensemble: strong_metrics expanded from 5→7 features (added voice, grammar). Strong signal weight increased from 0.30→0.40, base weight decreased from 0.50→0.40.
- AI pattern scoring: hedge_score weight increased from 0.25→0.30 (strongest individual signal).
- Total tests: 1696→1756.

## [0.15.1] - 2025-02-26

### Fixed
- **`fingerprint_randomizer.diversify_whitespace()` NO-OP** — was `pass`. Now implements paragraph break variation, comma/semicolon spacing normalization, and bullet marker style variation.
- **`fingerprint_randomizer.diversify_output()` too weak** — expanded from 2 micro-changes to 6 real transformations: em-dash↔en-dash styles, straight↔curly quotes, ellipsis variation, Oxford comma toggle, abbreviation expansion, number word variation.
- **`ai_backend` singleton per call** — `humanize_ai()` now caches `AIBackend` instances keyed by `(api_key, model, enable_oss)`, preserving circuit breaker state across calls.
- **`ai_backend` hardcoded OSS URL** — changed to configurable `oss_api_url` parameter with default fallback.
- **`ai_backend` blocking rate limiter** — releases lock during `time.sleep()` to avoid blocking other threads.
- **`ai_backend` no retry logic** — added retry loop with exponential backoff (up to 2 retries) for 5xx and connection errors.
- **POS tagger `-er` suffix always NOUN** — now correctly identifies comparative adjectives (bigger, faster, smaller, taller, etc.) as ADJ.
- **POS tagger German `-t` → VERB** — added 50+ common German nouns ending in `-t` (Arbeit, Angst, Dienst, Macht, etc.) as exceptions.
- **Benchmark `_bench_diversity` ×2 multiplier** — removed inflated score scaling. Diversity score now equals raw Jaccard distance.
- **Benchmark `_bench_meaning_retention` 0.5 fallback** — failed/unavailable samples now score 0.0 instead of inflating results.
- **Test tolerance for German artificiality** — added ±1.0 tolerance for micro-fluctuations caused by improved POS tagging.

### Added
- **CJK segmentation in pipeline** — CJK text automatically gets word-boundary injection before processing so downstream word-level stages work correctly.
- **Collocation-aware synonym selection** — naturalizer now uses `CollocEngine.best_synonym()` for context-aware replacement instead of random choice.
- **Word LM quality gate** — after naturalization, pipeline checks perplexity. Rolls back if text became >30% more predictable (AI-like).

### Changed
- Pipeline expanded to include CJK segmentation (stage 1b), paraphrasing (stage 7), and Word LM quality gate (stage 10b) in documentation.
- Architecture section updated: 72 Python modules, 40,677 lines of code.

## [0.15.0] - 2025-02-26

### Added
- **9 new core modules** — full audit gap closure (100% of C1-C4, H1-H7, M1-M5, N1-N8 items):
  - `ai_backend` — Three-tier AI backend: OpenAI API → OSS Gradio model (rate-limited, circuit-breaker) → built-in rules. New `humanize_ai()` function in core.
  - `pos_tagger` — Rule-based POS tagger for EN (500+ exceptions), RU/UK (200+ each), DE (300+). Universal tagset with context disambiguation.
  - `cjk_segmenter` — Chinese BiMM (2504-entry dict), Japanese character-type, Korean space+particle segmentation. Functions: `segment_cjk()`, `is_cjk_text()`, `detect_cjk_lang()`.
  - `syntax_rewriter` — 8 sentence-level transformations (active↔passive, clause inversion, enumeration reorder, adverb migration, etc.). 150+ irregular verbs, EN/RU/UK/DE support. Integrated as pipeline stage 7b.
  - `statistical_detector` — 35-feature AI text classifier with logistic regression. EN 85+ AI markers, RU 38+ markers. Integrated into `detect_ai()` with 60/40 weighted merge (heuristic/statistical).
  - `word_lm` — Word-level unigram/bigram language model replacing character-trigram perplexity. 14 language frequency tables. Perplexity, burstiness, and naturalness scoring.
  - `collocation_engine` — PMI-based collocation scoring for context-aware synonym ranking. EN ~130, RU ~30, DE ~20, FR ~15, ES ~12 collocations.
  - `fingerprint_randomizer` — Anti-fingerprint diversification: plan randomization, synonym pool variation, whitespace jitter, paragraph intensity variation. Integrated as pipeline stage 13b.
  - `benchmark_suite` — Automated quality benchmarking (6 dimensions): detection evasion, naturalness, meaning retention, diversity, length preservation, perplexity boost.
- **Pipeline expanded to 17 stages** — added `syntax_rewriting` (stage 7b) and anti-fingerprint diversification (stage 13b).
- **92 new tests** for all v0.15.0 modules — AI backend, POS tagger, CJK segmenter, syntax rewriter, statistical detector, word LM, collocation engine, fingerprint randomizer, benchmark suite, plus integration tests.

### Fixed
- **NO-OP `_reduce_adjacent_repeats()`** — was finding repeated words but doing `pass`. Now correctly removes second occurrences within a sliding window of 8 words, with article removal support.
- **Paragraph whitespace preservation** — `_reduce_adjacent_repeats()` now uses `re.split(r'(\s+)')` to tokenize while preserving `\n\n` paragraph breaks.
- **Syntax rewriter placeholder safety** — skips sentences containing `THZ_*` placeholders to prevent email/URL mangling.
- **Operator precedence bug** in syntax rewriter pipeline stage — fixed `return t, changes if ...` → `return (t, changes) if ...`.

### Changed
- **1,696 Python tests** — up from 1,604 (100% pass rate).
- **`detect_ai()` enhanced** — now returns `combined_score` (60% heuristic + 40% statistical) and `stat_probability` in results dict.

## [0.14.0] - 2025-02-26

### Added
- **3 new API functions** for advanced text processing:
  - `humanize_sentences()` — per-sentence AI scoring with graduated intensity; only processes sentences above a configurable AI probability threshold.
  - `humanize_variants()` — generates 1–10 humanization variants with different random seeds, sorted by quality (change ratio × AI score reduction).
  - `humanize_stream()` — generator that yields humanized text chunk-by-chunk (paragraph-by-paragraph) with progress tracking.
- **3 new analysis modules** (zero-dependency, fully offline):
  - `perplexity_v2` — character-level trigram cross-entropy model with background language models for EN/RU. Functions: `cross_entropy()`, `perplexity_score()` with naturalness score (0–100) and verdict.
  - `dict_trainer` — corpus analysis for custom dictionary building. Detects overused AI phrases, vocabulary stats, and generates replacement suggestions. Functions: `train_from_corpus()`, `export_custom_dict()`.
  - `plagiarism` — offline originality detection via n-gram fingerprinting and self-similarity analysis. Functions: `check_originality()`, `compare_originality()`.
- **Pipeline error isolation** (H1) — each processing stage wrapped in `_safe_stage()` with try/except; failing stages are skipped gracefully with logging instead of crashing the entire pipeline.
- **Partial rollback** (H4) — pipeline records checkpoints after each stage; on validation failure, rolls back stage-by-stage from the end to find the last valid state.
- **Pipeline profiling** (H6) — `time.perf_counter()` timing for every stage; `stage_timings` dict and `total_time` included in `metrics_after`.
- **Input sanitization** (H5) — `humanize()` now validates input: `TypeError` for non-str, early return for empty/whitespace, `ValueError` for texts exceeding 500K characters.
- **Thread-safe lazy loading** (M2) — double-checked locking with `threading.Lock()` on all 6 `_get_*()` module loaders; safe for concurrent use.
- **Instance-level plugins** (M3) — plugins are now copied per-instance in `Pipeline.__init__()`, preventing cross-instance interference.
- **44 new tests** for all v0.14.0 features — perplexity v2, dict trainer, plagiarism detection, sentence-level humanize, multi-variant output, streaming API, error isolation, profiling, input sanitization, thread safety, instance plugins.

### Fixed
- **`adversarial_calibrate` intensity bug** (H3) — parameter changed from `float` (0.0–1.0) to `int` (0–100) to match the rest of the API; internal calculations corrected.
- **`humanize_sentences` crash** — `detect_ai_sentences()` returns a list, not a dict; fixed `.get("sentences", [])` calls.
- **`test_none_text` assertion** — updated to expect `TypeError` after input sanitization was added.
- **All ruff lint errors** — resolved E501, F401, I001 across all source and new test files.

### Changed
- **1,604 Python tests** — up from 1,560 (100% pass rate).
- **Pipeline reliability** — 11 stages now have error isolation; pipeline continues even if individual stages fail.

  - **Turkish** — 60+ entries per category, Ottoman→modern Turkish replacements
- **Placeholder guard system** — all 6 text processing modules (structure, naturalizer, universal, decancel, repetitions, liveliness) now skip words and sentences containing placeholder tokens. Prevents `\x00THZ_*\x00` artifacts from leaking into output.
- **HTML block protection** — entire `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, `<blockquote>` blocks are now protected as single segments. Individual `<li>` items also protected.
- **Bare domain protection** — domains like `site.com.ua`, `portal.kh.ua`, `example.co.uk` are now protected without requiring `http://` prefix. Covers 24 TLDs and 18 country sub-TLDs.
- **Watermark cleaning in pipeline** — `WatermarkDetector.clean()` now runs automatically as the first pipeline stage (before segmentation), removing zero-width characters, homoglyphs, invisible Unicode, and spacing anomalies. Supports plugin hooks (`before`/`after` the `watermark` stage).
- **Language detection for new scripts** — Arabic (Unicode \u0600–\u06FF), CJK (Chinese \u4E00–\u9FFF, Japanese hiragana/katakana, Korean hangul), Turkish (marker-based with ş, ğ, ı).
- **54 new tests** for all v0.12.0 features — HTML protection, domain safety, placeholder safety, new languages, watermark pipeline, language detection, restore robustness.

### Fixed
- **Placeholder token leaks** — processing stages no longer corrupt `\x00THZ_*\x00` tokens through word-boundary regex, `.lower()` operations, or sentence splitting. 3-pass `restore()` recovery: exact match → case-insensitive → orphan cleanup.
- **Homoglyph detector corrupting Cyrillic** — removed Cyrillic `е` (U+0435), `а` (U+0430), `і` (U+0456) from `_SPECIAL_HOMOGLYPHS` table. These are normal Cyrillic/Ukrainian characters, not watermark homoglyphs. Contextual detection via `_CYRILLIC_TO_LATIN` / `_LATIN_TO_CYRILLIC` remains intact.
- **Duplicate dictionary keys** — removed F601 duplicates in ar.py (1), ja.py (1), tr.py (4).
- **Test for unknown language** — updated test to use truly unknown language codes instead of now-supported zh/ja.

### Changed
- **Pipeline stages** — now 12 stages (was 11): watermark → segmentation → typography → debureaucratization → structure → repetitions → liveliness → paraphrasing → universal → naturalization → validation → restore.
- **1,509 Python tests** — up from 1,455 (100% pass rate).

- **Benchmark speed** — improved from 42K to 56K chars/sec (33% faster) due to fast path optimization.

### Fixed
- **DE zero-change bug** — German text processed with 0% changes because dictionary contained only verb infinitives while text used noun forms (e.g., "implementieren" vs "Implementierung"). Fixed by adding inflected forms.
- **Natural text over-processing** — human-written text (AI ≤ 5%) no longer gets unnecessarily modified.
- **Validator change_ratio** — also migrated to SequenceMatcher for consistency.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-02-19

### Fixed
- **PHP SentenceSplitter** — `PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE` offset now properly cast to `int` (was implicit string).
- **PHP ToneAnalyzer** — `preg_match` offset cast to `int` for `mb_substr()` compatibility.
- **Python E741** — renamed ambiguous variable `l` → `sl`/`slen`/`wlen`/`pl`/`long_cnt` in 6 modules.
- **Duplicate dict keys** — removed duplicates in `en.py`, `uk.py`, `morphology.py`.
- **Unused variables** — cleaned up `commas`, `periods`, `quest_rate`, `paren_rate`, `modified`, `original` in detectors and naturalizer.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-02-19

### Added
- **AI Detection Engine** (`detect_ai()`) — 12 independent statistical metrics (entropy, burstiness, vocabulary richness, Zipf law, stylometry, AI patterns, punctuation diversity, coherence, grammar perfection, opening diversity, readability consistency, rhythm analysis). Designed to rival GPTZero.
- **Morphological Engine** (`morphology.py`) — rule-based lemmatization and form generation for RU, UK, EN, DE without external dependencies; used for smarter synonym matching.
- **Smart Sentence Splitter** (`sentence_split.py`) — handles abbreviations, decimals, initials, direct speech; replaces naive regex splitting.
- **Context-Aware Synonyms** (`context.py`) — word-sense disambiguation via collocations and topic detection (technology, business, casual).
- **Coherence Analyzer** (`coherence.py`) — paragraph-level analysis: lexical cohesion, transition quality, topic consistency, opening diversity.
- **Syntactic Paraphraser** (`paraphrase.py`) — clause swaps, passive-to-active, sentence splitting, adverb fronting, nominalization.
- **Tone Analyzer & Adjuster** (`tone.py`) — 7 tone levels (formal ↔ casual), formality/subjectivity scoring, marker-based tone adjustment for EN/RU/UK.
- **Watermark Detector & Cleaner** (`watermark.py`) — detects/removes zero-width chars, homoglyphs, invisible Unicode, spacing steganography, statistical watermarks.
- **Content Spinner** (`spinner.py`) — synonym-based spinning, spintax generation, variant production for EN/RU/UK.
- **REST API** (`api.py`) — zero-dependency HTTP server with 12 POST endpoints and health check; CORS support.
- **4 new profiles**: `academic`, `marketing`, `social`, `email`.
- **5 new readability metrics**: ARI, SMOG Index, Gunning Fog, Dale-Chall, `full_readability()`.
- New CLI commands: `--detect-ai`, `--paraphrase`, `--tone`, `--tone-analyze`, `--watermarks`, `--spin`, `--variants`, `--coherence`, `--readability`, `--api`.
- `texthumanize-api` entry point for running API server.

### Changed
- All 6 secondary language dictionaries (DE, FR, ES, PL, PT, IT) expanded with `sentence_starters`, `colloquial_markers`, `abbreviations`, `perplexity_boosters`.
- `_vary_sentence_structure()` in naturalizer.py fully reimplemented (was a no-op — both branches ended with `pass`).
- Morphology integrated into `repetitions.py` — synonyms resolved by lemma with form agreement.
- Version bumped to 0.4.0.

### Fixed
- `_vary_sentence_structure()` no longer silently skips all transformations.
